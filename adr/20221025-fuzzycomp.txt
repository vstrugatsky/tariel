Experimented to do a fuzzy compare between the Symbols.name and the company name in the tweet.
- Install python-levenshtein and fuzzywuzzy
- Got decent results with the fuzz.WRatio method, but it fell short when the tweet
referenced a short company name such as UPS or IBM but Symbols.name has the full name only

Decision: set aside for now

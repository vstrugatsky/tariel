Data model re-work - think deeply
- Exchanges load from ISO 10383

- Symbols with a uniqueness on Exchange + Company

2022-Sep-19
- convert data from symbols_polygon to symbols
- establish rules based on values - perhaps a separate exchange_acronyms contraption - because needed in code
- deprecate polygon symbols
- repoint dividends, splits, earnings_reports to new
- deprecate estimates

2022-Sep-26
- Setup Github repo - DONE

2022-Sep-27
- Remap exchanges, exchange acronyms, symbols to new tables
- adopted with session() mechanism for lookups
- Reloaded US and Canada symbols from EOD
- Loaded UK (XLON) symbols from EOD

2022-Sep-28
- Remapped and reloaded splits
- figured out how to define compound foreign keys
- figured out how to use joins
- figured out how to define a function args and return types in another function's signature - Callable
- wrote tests for Symbol.find_exchange_by_symbol_and_country

2022-Sep-29
- Remap and reload dividends
- create Polygon -> EOD symbol conversion
- allow for more than one symbol per country (as long as exchanges are different)
- refactor polygon load to make load_from_polygon less mysterious

Next steps:
- regularly run symbols, splits, dividends
- requests: configure timeouts
- think about how to deal with deactivated symbols
- Get to earnings reports

Data model re-work - think deeply
- Exchanges load from ISO 10383

- Symbols with a uniqueness on Exchange + Company

2022-Sep-19
- convert data from symbols_polygon to symbols
- establish rules based on values - perhaps a separate exchange_acronyms contraption - because needed in code
- deprecate polygon symbols
- repoint dividends, splits, earnings_reports to new
- deprecate estimates

2022-Sep-26
- Setup Github repo - DONE

2022-Sep-27
- Remap exchanges, exchange acronyms, symbols to new tables
- adopted with session() mechanism for lookups
- Reloaded US and Canada symbols from EOD
- Loaded UK (XLON) symbols from EOD

2022-Sep-28
- Remapped and reloaded splits
- figured out how to define compound foreign keys
- figured out how to use joins
- figured out how to define a function args and return types in another function's signature - Callable
- wrote tests for Symbol.find_exchange_by_symbol_and_country

2022-Sep-29
- Remap and reload dividends
- create Polygon -> EOD symbol conversion
- allow for more than one symbol per country (as long as exchanges are different)
- refactor polygon load to make load_from_polygon less mysterious
- research failures to convert Polygon -> EOD: minor, not worth getting to perfection

2022-Oct-2:
- regularly run (a) symbols, (b) splits, (c) dividends (d) update to false SQL
- requests: configure timeouts
- deal with deactivated symbols (through UPDATED)

2022-Oct-3:
- Struggled to deal with deactivated symbols because of poor data quality from EOD (delisted tickers appeared as active)
- Introduced Jobs

2022-Oct-4:
- Started using Strategy pattern and isolate load jobs into separate classes - SUCCESS
- Changed approach to limit to US stocks and rely on Polygon
- Implemented LoadSymbolsFromPolygon
- redone table Symbols

2022-Oct-5,6,7:
- Added test to MarketIdentifiers
- Remodeled Symbols, Dividends to use integer primary and foreign keys and a unique key with delisted

2022-Oct-8:
- Implemented symbol locator logic in Dividends
- introduced pytest and the tests directory
- tests for symbol locator logic
- loaded dividends
- python object sort using lambda coolness

2022-Oct-9:
- Remodeled, implemented and loaded Splits
- Implement writing warning messages to DB indexed off jobs
- Jobs table: added limit to params
- Refactor all other model classes, esp. untangle EOD from Symbols
- Fixed important bug in Symbol.find_exchange_by_symbol_and_country
- SQL to delete duplicate rows in Job_Log

2022-Oct-10:
- Partially modeled EarningsReports
- Refactored twitter.py to conform to new design patterns
- Massive regex -> tested!

2022-Oct-11-12:
- support CAD
- wrote all transformations and tests
- saving works!
- fixed rounding issue

2022-Oct-13:
Tweets loading:
- Added support for NII
- Added support for basic guidance
- Added logging
- Added support and tests for canadian symbols in cashtags

2022-Oct-14:
Supported parsing of earnings from more than one Twitter account using Strategy pattern

2022-Oct-14:
Improved error logging
Added logging of additions, updates, errors and warnings

2020-Oct-16:
- externalize configuration
- parameterize to allow external running
- daily_jobs.sh
- consolidated_schema and reference data

2022-Oct-17:
- support priorities of Twitter providers (Livesquawk over Marketcurrents)
- support separate starting date for Twitter providers

Next steps:
- parsing format at Livesquawk changed: improve and improve detection when format changes
- check out flake8
- test job_log: recently nothing added
- automate daily jobs via launchd
- parse guidance from Livesquawk
- research and load historical prices

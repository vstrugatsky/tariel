Complete nightmare using Google OAuth, tried with:
- desktop credentials - failed, required redirect
- web credentials - failed, required redirect
- limited-input credentials - also failed
- service account - failed as it only works with the Google Workspace and a superadmin account.

Workaround:
- if a 2FA is on the Google account, there is a feature to add an additional "trusted password"

Decision:
Give it a try as other methods are too painful
